# Overview

This application allows you to easily input the difficult characters that you need for pinyin. It of course also works for other languages such as French.

[Here you can see a live demo](https://pinyin.braham.biz/)


# Developing
**This project asumes that you have grunt *globally* installed. If this is not the case please execute the following command:**
(*On Unix based systems you need root rights*)

`npm install -g grunt`

During development you should execute `grunt build`. This copies everything from the source to the build folder. I reccomend starting a http-server in the build folder. To autoamate this processes, execute `grunt watch`.

If you want to create your own minified version for production, exectute `grunt dist`.
